I have used JavaScript for implementing Assignment 1 and 2.
Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 are on .txt file. Please copy and paste JS code on a console or any IDE of your choice.


For assignment 3, 
I have used Angular 4 framework. 
You can download my project and on terminal go to my project and run "npm install" to install all the dependencies. 
Then run "npm start" and go to localhost:4200.

I have implemented every feature of assignment 3 including responsiveness, password validation, routing and delete an item. 
I have additionally implemented an add item field to add extra items to list.
